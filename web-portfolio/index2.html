                        I've acquired all these skills through 3 years of college and mostly through reading articles, watching youtube and creating a network of people to ask for help. Doing this, I believe, has made me more of a self sufficient person.
                        Asking for help and knowing what you don't know is more important sometimes than being overconfident. I prefer to work alone for the most part but I love the ability to bounce ideas off a real person and not a rubber duck. Feedback and opinions are important to me.

                    I've been drawing for most of my childhood and adulthood, it's more of a hobby and passion. Professionally it can add rich detail to different projects. Not only that but I think it makes me more creative. 
                    Additionally, drawing teaches you patience and to know when you're "done", which is hard for any designer or artist to acknowledge as it can seem like your work is never quite finished. The following images
                    are different drawings I've done across different mediums. Primarily being digital, while the others are pencil drawings finished in ink and painted.

                The following is mockup work I did using AdobeXD. Having no "industry work" it's a challenge to practice what you know sometimes. However, I think that mockups are a wonderful way to practice, to even the most skilled professionals.

                The process of creating a website is unique to everyone. My own process of creating websites is personal to me and will likely keep changing. It's better for everyone involved if you have clear ideas and direction. Coding is time consuming, there's really no use 
                in making it more tedious by not knowing where to start or end. I absolutely, positively do not like when I'm going into coding "blind". I love having a prototype that I've made that I like to just "copy" (it's not cheating if it's my design).

                    <p class="text-columns">
                        The first part of going into a project is to start with knowing the product. If I do not know anything about my product how can I expect to reach my audience effectively? It also means that I must know my product’s competitor. <br>
                        What do their designs look like? Is there anything I can improve upon? What are they doing right? What are they doing wrong? What do I personally like/dislike? <br> Picking, pulling, and editing helps finalize my design, helping to inspire me to pull through on a project, 
                        or capitalize on a competitors mistake. Even simply finding websites my client or I like is beneficial in creating something we'll both end up liking.

            <h2 class="subtitle">2. WIREFRAMES & <br> PROTOTYPES</h2>
                <div class="text-columns-container">
                    <p class="text-columns">
                        Wireframes act as my initial thoughts on how the design could look and function. This is an early draft of the site's potential. <br> There will be a variety of different ideas at this stage, but the point of this is to narrow down the ideas I have. Personally, I prefer to start off with paper and pencil drafts. <br> After narrowing down the wireframe I will then create a prototype which acts as my first “final” draft, in the sense that it is a beefed up version of my wireframe.
                        Other draft ideas I use include: style tiles or mood boards that include font choices, colors, buttons, and other features. During this phase it is also critical for myself to write/draw a site map that includes every important button and to which page(s) they lead to. Simple, intuitive navigation on a site is essential for the product, and if users cannot access everything on the page quickly and efficiently, most of the time a user will not even bother. I know I wouldn't.

                <div class="text-columns-container">
                    <p class="text-columns">
                        The finalized version of my prototype is exactly how my site would look and function. It is now ready to be developed and given any last bits of attention. During this phase, some changes may occur but while sticking to the blue print. I will then in turn use it to guide me to code and often will use it as a reference. <br> Many procedures (as explained beforehand), aid in creating a fully operational website. It always saves time and money going the extra mile creating the basic layout, and potential stylization of the website.
                        The burden of development is now a lot lighter. Coding without the proper blueprint is almost always an issue. Although, everyone’s design process may differ, one constant that persists is that planning is essential before development. These “steps”, are often interchangeable and simultaneous, and this is how I’ve come to create websites. <br> I am by no means an expert and I still stand to learn a lot more. I'm excited to continue my journey as a junior developer and learn as much as possible. Thank you for making it this far.
